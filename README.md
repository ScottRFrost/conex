# conex
This addon tries to replace some functionality from the discontinued *TabGroups* with some differences:

## Differences to tabgroups

- it lacks the big "Manage my TabGroups" overview window
- tab groups are implemented via containers
- the quick search contains thumbnail of the results
- the quick search includes bookmarks and history

## Enable tab hiding

Conex uses a feature which only exists in Firefox >= 59.0a1 updated after the 19th of January 2018. 

At the moment, tab hiding has to be enabled manually: In the location bar, type in `about:config`, filter for `extensions.webextensions.tabhide.enabled` and set the value to `true`.

## Installation

Just install from the [official mozilla addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/conex)

## Getting back my last tab group session

So: Firefox Quantum rolled in, tab groups doesn't work anymore and you would like to get back
your last tab groups session? Here is a way you can get a tab groups backup which again you
can import to conex (note: only tested it briefly, but it's worth a try):

- download [Firefox ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/?q=English%20(US)) (this still supports old extension) and install it
- close Firefox Quantum
- open Firefox ESR
- if you see tab groups in your addon section but it is disabled, please do the following:
    - open the url `about:config` and acknowledge the warning. Change the following settings:

            xpinstall.signatures.required: false

- if you are lucky, your old session is restored and you can just open tab-groups and create a manual backup which you can use as an import for conex
- if your session is not restored, all hope is not lost:
  - go to tab-groups preferences and open the 'Backup / Restore' section
  - click the 'Load Groups and Tabs From ...' button and select 'Previous Session'
  - once imported, create the manual backup now
